We have a Private List of Users that are blocked from worlds that world owners can opt into or out of and can override with a personal Whitelist and Black List

For Opt in members this would mean that when one world owner adds a a Person to the community ban list the person is added to this list and all other opt in owner worlds would prevent this user form being able to access their worlds

World owners can override this list by adding the user to a white list there for granting the person added to the community list access to their personal worlds

they can also add players to a personal black list this list is not added to the community list and is only acted upon on their own worlds


for more serious violations or members that have had x number of ban requests by x number of unique world owners this is when Sansar would investigate the issue

All Community ban list entries will require a reason to be entered so Sansar staff can see why the ban was in place

It could be added to the options for opt in at what level this world block is implemented ie 
opt in >0 comunity ban entries' = ban from my worlds, > 10 adds = ban from my worlds and so on

there could also be the option for you to block the person and add to world ban list public or private

a pop up to opt in to the person being kicked from your world if added to the list (while you are online) or to remain so you can ask what this is about and chose weather to act on this or not

Opt out world owners will make or not make a world ban list and if they do their lists will not affect or be affected by the community one or have the option to add to the community list

I am sorry if this is not clear i have never been good at getting my idears down on paper but please feel free to ask me to clear uyp a point i may not have got across
